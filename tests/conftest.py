"""Shared pytest fixtures.

The server's base logger (``isabelle_pool_server``, server/app/core/logging.py) has
``propagate = False`` so its records are not emitted twice via the root
fallback handlers. pytest's ``caplog`` only listens on the root logger, so
without help no assertion on ``caplog.records`` can ever see a server log line
(2026-10-05: test_cleanup_offloop / test_gateway_resilience had been failing
since they were written). This fixture attaches caplog's handler to the base
logger for the duration of every test.

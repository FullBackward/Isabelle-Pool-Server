   * Verify a whole proof CHUNK in one shot: insert it as a single edit (parallel proof
   * checking stays on per parallel_proofs), then return a JSON per-command status report
   * under ONE wall budget (no per-command timeouts). On budget expiry the report is partial
   * and names the still-`running` line (the loop). Requires the theory to be begun.
   * Consumed via POST .../verify_chunk — the chunk-centric MCP's only execution tool.
   *
   * TRANSACTIONAL: the chunk is kept in the theory node only if it verifies fully
   * (`Chunk_Report.success`); on any failure OR timeout it is rolled back via
   * `discard_last_edit` so the attempt leaves no trace. This makes repeated attempts
   * independent: the next try can't hit "Duplicate fact declaration" (re-declaring the same
   * lemma) or "Bad context for command ... -- using reset state" (a still-running command
   * poisoning the node), and the removal edit cancels the obsolete (e.g. looping `metis`)
   * command instead of leaving it churning. Since the theory is begun, send_edit always
   * records the chunk as the last text edit, so discard removes exactly this chunk.
   *
   * The report carries `proof_open`: even a `success` chunk (no command errors) may leave an
   * UNCLOSED proof — e.g. `theorem ... using assms` or a trailing `have ...` with no `qed`.
   * Such a chunk is kept (so the caller can `sledgehammer` the open goal), but `proof_open`
   * is true so the caller knows the theorem is NOT actually proved and must close it (or
   * rollback) before starting a new `theorem`/`lemma` — declaring one while a proof is open
   * is exactly what triggers "Bad context for command -- using reset state". `proof_open` is
   * the ML `Toplevel.is_proof` predicate (block lifetime), NOT bare subgoal counting: a
   * successful terminal `show` leaves zero subgoals but the block still awaits `qed`, and
   * batch builds reject that with "Goal present in this block". In that situation the report
   * also carries `pending_qed`=true so the caller knows the only missing step is `qed`
   * (vs. real remaining goals, which need proof work). For a rolled-back (failed) chunk
   * both are false (nothing was kept).

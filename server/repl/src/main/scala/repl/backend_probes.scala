/** Transient read-only probes of [[ReplBackend]]: open subgoals, in-proof
 *  predicate, local/global facts, sledgehammer, rendered proof state, source
 *  text, and the generic `probe_transient` diagnostic primitive. These serve
 *  BOTH MCP servers — the chunk-centric one (state / subgoals / facts /
 *  sledgehammer / diagnostic tools) and the LSP-like read-only one.
 *
 *  Every STATE query is an OVERLAY QUERY, not a text edit (since 2026-09-30):
 *  a Query_Operation registered in REPL.ML is attached as a temporary document
 *  overlay to the node's LAST command (`Repl_Session.current_state_host`), runs
 *  against that command's result state — which IS the current toplevel state,
 *  exactly what an appended command would see — and its instance-tagged
 *  results are read from the host's command_results
 *  (`Document_Utils.overlay_query`, the machinery `sledgehammer_at` already
 *  used). The document, rollback chain and command history are never touched,
 *  so there is nothing to discard and no probe can leak into the script. (The
 *  previous design inserted `ML_val ‹Repl.send_*_tagged …›` commands and read
 *  replies from per-backend Scala.Fun_Strings channel queues; a probe whose
 *  reply timed out stayed in the document — docs/ISSUES.md tracker REPL-1.)
 *  The wait is bounded by a per-query budget; on expiry the overlay is removed
 *  (cancelling the print task) and an error is raised — the same exception
 *  contract the channel timeouts had, so the Python side is unchanged.
 *
 *  FINISHED THEORIES (document ends with theory `end`): after `end` there is
 *  no theory context, so `open_subgoals`/`in_proof`/`sledgehammer`/
 *  `get_proof_state` short-circuit to their definitional answers (a successful
 *  `end` means no proof is open) and the fact queries host on the last command
 *  BEFORE `end` (`skip_end`), i.e. observe the state the theory closed with.
 *
 *  `probe_transient` is the one remaining INSERTION probe: it runs an
 *  arbitrary caller-supplied Isar command (`thm`, `find_theorems`, …), which
 *  no print function can do. It inserts the command, reads its output, and
 *  removes the edit again (before a trailing `end` via
 *  `Repl_Session.with_probe_before_end`, whose bracket always removes it). */

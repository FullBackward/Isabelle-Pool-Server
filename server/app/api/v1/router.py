"""v1 API aggregate router + compatibility facade.

The endpoints live in ``server/app/api/v1/routes/`` (one module per concern);
this module composes them in registration order (route matching is ordered)
and re-exports the names that external code and older tests imported from
here. New code should import from ``routes.<module>``, ``deps`` and
``serializers`` directly; the re-exports below are kept for one release.

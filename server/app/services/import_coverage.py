"""Do a session's theories cover the imports a client asks ``enter_theory`` for?

IPS fixes a session's theory context when the session is acquired: a node's
context comes from the wrapper theory that imports the session's theories,
and the imports in the node's own header only gate loading (Scala
``Edit_Utils.get_thy_header_edits``). A request for imports outside that
context used to be accepted silently, and the theory was then checked
without them (training-metrics review afd3de9: a corpus replay on ``Main``
sessions; the July HOL-Analysis small-step run, 2 of 93 files). The backend
answers from Isabelle's own import graph (``Repl_Session.uncovered_imports``);
the route turns a non-empty answer into a 409.
